The Bracket
=======

This is, obviously, an art/critical design project more than something that you should build to try out. The shock mechanism I'm using is the flash from a disposable camera like [this](http://www.amazon.com/Disposable-Kodak-Camera-3Pack) and is, seriously, quite painful. The OF application that is used to set the wearers income will be included here but is not at present, mostly because I haven't been able to build+test it against ios8 or any reasonably recent iPhone. It's very simple though and basically just leverages ofxBLE to show a prompt when it detects the bracket and send a message when the user enters an income.
